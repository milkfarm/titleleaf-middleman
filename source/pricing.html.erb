        and a monthly subscription plan.

        TitleLeaf <%= setup_link %> depends on the complexity of your online business and the degree of customization desired. The subscription plan is simpler to calculate, being based on the file storage needed. The following table lists the standard TitleLeaf subscription plans currently offered and the approximate amount of products it will accommodate. If, as your catalog expands, you exceed your allotted file storage, you will be notified before being upgraded (pro rata) to a larger plan.
