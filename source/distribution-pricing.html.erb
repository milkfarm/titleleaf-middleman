    <p>It is possible to run TitleLeaf in a <em>faceless</em> mode whereby there is no public ecommerce site. In this mode, TitleLeaf functions as an asset management and distribution application exclusively. There is a one-time setup fee of $2400. Thereafter, the monthly subscription plan is based on the amount of file storage needed. The following table lists the <em>faceless</em> TitleLeaf subscription plans currently offered. If you exceed your allotted file storage, you will be notified before being upgraded to a larger plan.</p>
