      <h3><i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i> Multiple Formats</h3>

    <div class="item">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-code"></i> ONIX Support</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Book Excerpts</h3>
      <p>Excerpts are TitleLeaf's analogy to Amazon’s “Look Inside the Book” functionality. It allows potential customers to sample titles online. The publisher controls the amount of pages provided in the excerpt.</p>
