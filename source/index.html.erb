    <h3>Stop Retrofitting, Start Selling</h3>
    <p>Adjusting a generic e-commerce solution to address the needs of the publishing industry is time-consuming and not your team's strength. Focus on data quality and product message instead of trying to match the functionality of your competitor's sites.</p>

    <h3>Be True to Your Brand</h3>
    <p>Don't be shoe-horned into a visually-restrictive e-commerce application. TitleLeaf offers complete control over the look and feel of your site. Have an art director but not a team to code? We'll work side-by-side with your designers and editors to create a site that reflects your brand and your message.</p>
