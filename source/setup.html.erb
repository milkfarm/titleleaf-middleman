      <h4>What does Design Mockup encompass?</h4>
      <p>Design mockup (aka, realization) equates to the creation of the design template in an Adobe-PhotoShop-compatible format and the transformation of that design into representative HTML/CSS/JS files. Depending on the complexity, the design encompasses approximately 5 layouts.</p>

      <h4>What does Design Implementation encompass?</h4>
      <p>Design implementation is the process of applying the HTML/CSS/JS design template files (created in the Design Realization/Mockup phase) to each page within the TitleLeaf public-facing site.</p>

      <h4>In what format do I provide the design?</h4>
      <p>For either the <em>Self-Starter</em> or <em>Collaborative</em> package, you'll provide the design of a minimum of four pages: 1) Home page, 2) List page, 3) Set page, 4) Title page. Design files must be communicated in layered PhotoShop files and HTML/CSS/JS files.</p>

      <h4>What's the custom theme design process?</h4>
      <p>Based on materials and directions that you provide, we will first deliver an initial design in JPG format. A maximum of 3 design iterations are available if the initial design is not accepted. Upon you accepting the design, we will then convert to HTML/CSS/JS and implement in the TitleLeaf application.</p>

      <h4>Are custom setup plans available?</h4>
      <p>Yes, custom setup plans are <%= contact_link name: 'available upon request' %> to accommodate any range of collaboration.</p>

    <div class="col-right">

      <h4>Is technical support included?</h4>
      <p>
        Up to one hour of technical support is included with any monthly
        subscription plan for the first year of the plan. A
        <%= link_to 'guide', '/guide' %>
        is also available for self-learners.
      </p>

      <h4>Can I request design changes after launch?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes. Adjustments can be made to the design after launch by
        <%= link_to 'scheduling the work', '/guides/knowledge-base/can-i-request-site-changes' %>
        with the development team. Our current hourly rate for "front-end" design work is <%= data.config.hourly_rate %>.
      </p>

      <h4>Can I request data assistance in the future?</h4>
      <p>Yes. Beyond technical support, our team does provide data management assistance and training at an hourly rate of <%= data.config.hourly_rate %>.</p>

      <h4>What's the data setup process?</h4>
      <p>You deliver the data in any format available. We will enter this data into the templates and import into TitleLeaf. From there, both of us can test/verify the data before launching the live site.</p>

      <h4>After setup, do you maintain the data?</h4>
      <p>No, it is your responsibility to maintain the data after the initial setup. TitleLeaf has a thorough administrative interface that allows you to adjust the content on an ongoing basis.</p>

      <h4>Do you offer discounts for start-ups?</h4>
      <p>Yes, special setup pricing is available to organizations with less than 5 full-time employees.</p>
