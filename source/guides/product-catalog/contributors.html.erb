<p>The contributors module allow a publisher to manage authors, illustrators and other people involved in the creation of books in a central location. For example, changing the bio for a contributor cascades that information to all the books that the contributor helped create.</p>

<p>You can navigate to a contributor's page in multiple ways. The most direct method is by selecting the <em>Contributors</em> item in the <em>Catalog</em> menu. Use the form at the top of the Contributors list page to search for the contributor in question.</p>

<p>Another way to navigate to a contributor's page is by clicking the contributors name in the <em>Participants</em> section of <em>Edit Product</em> page.</p>

<p>Regardless of the method used to find the contributor, the <em>Edit Contributor</em> page allows full control of the contributor's information.</p>
