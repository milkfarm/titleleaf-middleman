<p>A common scenario for series publishers is the addition of titles to a pre-existing series. The <a href="/guides/knowledge-base/set-vs-series">set</a> that previously represented the series will need to be removed from sale. A new set encompassing all the titles now in the series will also need to be created and activated for sale. Furthermore, it is important to record the relationship of the old set to the new set. TitleLeaf accommodates all of these data issues. The procedure below demonstrates.</p>

<p>Prerequisite:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both the old set and the new set must exist in the database prior to beginning this procedure. In the following procedure, I will use the two pre-existing sets of "Exploring Our Oceans" as shown below. The set with 16 titles is to replace the set with 8 titles.</li>
</ul>

<p><%= cdn_image "titleleaf-products-related.png", alt: "TitleLeaf: Admin list of products with same name" %></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to the <em>Edit Product</em> page of the old product, then click the <em>Product Formats</em> item in the <em>Jump to</em> menu.</p>
    <p><%= cdn_image "titleleaf-product-edit-old-jump.png", alt: "TitleLeaf: Edit product, old set, jump to menu" %></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each Product Format in the list, set the <em>Status</em> value to "Replaced". Doing so means that the product will not be purchasable on the public website.</p>
    <p><%= cdn_image "titleleaf-product-formats-old.png", alt: "TitleLeaf: Product formats list, old set" %></p>
    <p><%= cdn_image "titleleaf-product-formats-edit-replaced.png", alt: "TitleLeaf: Edit product format, status" %></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Return to the <em>Edit Product</em> page of the old product (eg, click the product name in the <em>Product Formats</em> list).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Near the bottom of the edit page is a section entitled <em>Related Products</em>. Add the new product to the related product list. Define the relation as "Replaced". Doing so means that a site visitor will be redirected to the new product page, instead of the old product page.</p>
    <p><%= cdn_image "titleleaf-product-edit-related-0.png", alt: "TitleLeaf: Related products" %></p>
    <p><%= cdn_image "titleleaf-product-edit-related-1.png", alt: "TitleLeaf: Related products, dropdown" %></p>
    <p><%= cdn_image "titleleaf-product-edit-related-2.png", alt: "TitleLeaf: Related products, item added" %></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the "Save" button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verify the public URL to the old product redirects to the new product.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
