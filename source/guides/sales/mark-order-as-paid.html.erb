<p>If the payment type is credit card, then marking an order as "Paid" will also attempt to "capture" the amount from the associated credit card. Note: To reach this stage, TitleLeaf has received authorization from the merchant bank to capture the amount from the credit card. Capturing payment can also be performed through the merchant website.</p>
