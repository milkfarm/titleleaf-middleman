<p>In TitleLeaf, a "Product" can have one or more "Product Formats". The Product attributes can be found on the "Edit Product" form of the Admin UI or the "products" ingestion template. The Product Format attributes can be found on the "Edit Product Format" form of the Admin UI or the "product_formats" ingestion template.</p>

<p>The "products" template and the "products-with-one-format" template contain attributes for both Product and Product Format records. These templates are offered as convenience methods to create/update Product <em>and</em> Product Format attributes simultaneously.</p>

<p>If, as a publisher, you release your product in multiple formats simultaneously, it is recommended that you use the "products" template to create a Product. Thereafter, you can ingest the "product_formats" template to create the associated Product Formats. Populate the "proprietary_product_id" column in "product_formats" template with the value in the "proprietary_id" of the "products" template. In this way, the Product Format records are linked to the appropriate Product record. NB: The Product record must exist in TitleLeaf before assigning a Product Format record to it.</p>
