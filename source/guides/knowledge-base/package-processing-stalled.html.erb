<p>Depending upon the number of formats associated with your products, it is possible that TitleLeaf will stall when trying to process a large amount of products. To avoid stalled package processing, set the <em>Package Limit</em> to <em>4000</em> or lower.</p>

<p>The <em>Package Limit</em> field is accessed from the <em>Settings</em> menu under the Management heading.</p>
