<p>Textile is a lightweight markup language. It is an easier way to style text in comparison to HTML. Textile converts its marked-up text input to valid, well-formed XHTML and also inserts character entity references for apostrophes, opening and closing single and double quotation marks, ellipses and em dashes.</p>
