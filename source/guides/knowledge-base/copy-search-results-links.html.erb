<p>To be able to copy a link to certain search results:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Perform the search and adjust the filters as desired.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the "Save Search" link.</p>
    <p><img src="http://guide.titleleaf.com/uploads/missing.gif?13fYWy1" alt="Save Search Results" /></p>
</li>
  <li>
<p>Give a descriptive name to the search being saved. Upon clicking "Create", you'll be redirected to your search results.</p>
    <p><img src="http://guide.titleleaf.com/uploads/missing.gif?13fZLqs" alt="New Search" /></p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>Copy the URL in the address bar. That's the search link. It's most likely long. I recommend using a link shortener such as <a href="http://bitly.com">Bitly</a>.</p>
    <p><img src="http://guide.titleleaf.com/uploads/missing.gif?1q0Abe6" alt="search-index-url" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
