<p>TitleLeaf processes long-running tasks in the background. Each background process is represented by a <em>job</em> in the TitleLeaf's Admin interface.</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>Jobs are processed by a <em>job worker</em>. Intermittently, the job worker may stop running. To test if it is running, click the <em>Test Job Worker</em> link in the sidebar.</p>
    <p><%= cdn_image 'test-job-worker.png', alt: 'Test job worker' %></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>If the worker is running, the message will appear in green. No action is required.</p>
    <p><%= cdn_image 'job-worker-running.png', alt: 'Job worker running' %></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>If the worker is not running, the message will appear in red. Click the <em>Start</em> link in the message to start the job worker.</p>
    <p><%= cdn_image 'job-worker-not-running.png', alt: 'Job worker not running' %></p>
  </li>

</ul>
