<p>If a user repeatedly enters an incorrect password, their associated account will eventually be <em>locked</em>. They will be presented with a message saying their account is locked and they will be sent an email as well. The email message will contain a link to unlock their account.</p>

<p>Note: If the user did not receive the email message, it is possible that they no longer have access to their email account. In this situation, you might need to <a href="http://guide.titleleaf.com/sales/change-user-name-email-category-or-password">edit both the user's email address and password</a>, in addition to unlocking the account, as shown below.</p>
