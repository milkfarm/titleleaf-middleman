<p>If you attempt an ingestion and receive a "can't fire event" message, it means TitleLeaf failed to process the entire file within the alotted time (~6 hours). TitleLeaf limits all processing jobs to avoid overloading the server.</p>

<div class="block-error" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Can't fire event `started` in current state `processing` for `Ingestion` with ID 9
</div>

<p>This error is most often associated with large ingestion files (> 25MB). If youâ€™re ingesting such a file, we recommend splitting it into multiple parts to speed processing.</p>
