<p>When using the Google Doc template to organize website data, the user must download the file to their local machine in order to later import into titleleaf. The data must be downloaded as a CSV (comma-separated values). To do so, select the following menu item: File &gt; Download as &gt; Comma Separated Values. See screenshot.</p>
