<p class="block-warning">
  Dropbox is no longer a supported destination. If a distribution channel does
  not have alternative destination, simply specify an email for the channel.
  TitleLeaf will store the package in the cloud and send a shareable link to
  the specified email.
</p>

<p>To be able to distribute data and assets to a partner via Dropbox, the partner must provide TitleLeaf with access to their Dropbox account. To do so, have the partner visit the following page on your site:</p>

<p><code>https://YOURDOMAIN/dropbox_destinations/new</code>
</p>

<p>This is what the page looks like on the Demo application:</p>

<p><%= cdn_image "demo-dropbox-authorization.png", alt: "Demo: Dropbox Linking" %></p>

<p>The partner should click the <em>Initiate Linking</em> button.</p>

<p>If the partner is not currently logged in to their Dropbox account, then they will be presented with a login form</p>

<p><%= cdn_image "dropbox-signin-authorization.png", alt: "Dropbox: Signin form before authorization" %></p>

<p>After logging in, the partner will be presented with an authorization form.</p>

<p><%= cdn_image "dropbox-authorization.png", alt: "Dropbox: Authorization form" %></p>

<p>The partner should click the <em>Allow</em> button. After doing so, they will be redirected to your site.</p>

<p>Authorization is complete. You will now be able to associate a Channel with this Destination and subsequently distribute data/assets to them.</p>
