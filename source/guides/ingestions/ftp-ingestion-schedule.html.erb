<p>
  The root directory of the FTP account is processed every hour on the hour
  (e.g., 8:00, 9:00, 10:00, etc). You can consult the ingestion list after
  thirty minutes to determine if your uploaded files were properly processed.
  Keep in mind that the file name dictates how the file is processed.
  <em>
    If the file name does not adhere to the naming convention, then the file
    will fail to be processed and will be placed in the <strong>failed</strong>
    directory of your FTP account.
  </em>

<p class="block-notice">
  Outside the ingestion schedule, you can submit a request for TitleLeaf to
  process your ingestion directory on demand. Click the
  "Process Your Ingestion Account" link in the sidebar of the Ingestion module.
