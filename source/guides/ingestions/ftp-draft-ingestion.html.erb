<p>Draft (aka pagination) PDF files can be added to the database via the Ingestion section of the website admin or via FTP. This document describes the latter. </p>

<p>If you have yet to receive an FTP account for ingestion purposes (which is distinct from that for production purposes), please <%= link_to 'create a support ticket', data.config.support_url %>.</p>

<p>Please be aware of the general <a href="/guides/ingestions/ftp-ingestion-rules">FTP ingestion rules</a> before uploading.</p>

<p>Draft file specifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>PDF format</li>
</ul>

<p>Draft file naming convention:</p>

<ul>
<li>13-digit ISBN + "_draft" + extension (e.g., 9781585368396_draft.pdf)</li>
<li>Do not include hyphens in the ISBN</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The root directory of the FTP account is <a href="/guides/ingestions/ftp-ingestion-schedule">processed on regular basis</a>. If your files do not appear in the ingestion list after a processing cycle, check the <em>failed</em> directory of the FTP account.</p>
