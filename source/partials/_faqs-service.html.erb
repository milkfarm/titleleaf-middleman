      calculated using a 9 AM to 5 PM workday and a 4-day workweek
      (Monday-Thursday) in the Pacific time zone. Support/training

    <h4>How do I contact the TitleLeaf support team?</h4>
    <p>To contact the support team, submit a ticket via the <%= support_link %>. TitleLeaf does not provide support via email, phone, or any other method.</p>

    <h4>What is the payment schedule for service plans?</h4>
    <p>An invoice will be emailed on the first of each month representing service for said month. Similar to subscriptions, the invoice is to be paid on receipt via credit card.</p>

    <h4>Are meetings free-of-charge?</h4>
    <p>No, meetings are treated as a service and, therefore, reduce available service hours for the given month.</p>

    <h4>What is the Term of the service plan?</h4>
    <p>The Term of a service plan can vary from 1 month to 1 year. Each individual service agreement will define the commencement date and the length of the Term.</p>

    <h4>Is there a discount for agreeing to a longer Term?</h4>
    <p>
      Yes, by agreeing to a 1-year Term, you receive
      <%= data.config.service_discount %> off TitleLeaf's current hourly
      rate of <%= data.config.hourly_rate %>.
    </p>

    <h4>Can the hours rollover?</h4>
    <p>No, if the maximum hour allotment is not achieved in a given month, the remaining hours do not rollover to the next month. For this reason, we recommend maintaining a backlog of tickets for the TitleLeaf support team to address as needed.</p>

    <h4>Are overages allowed?</h4>
    <p>No, if the maximum hour allotment is achieved in a given month, further work will be performed in the subsequent month.</p>
